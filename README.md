A repository that contains the file structure of a regular WordPress theme. This should be treated as a template repostory which is why it was made that as well.
Reference to this repository for the right structutre of a WordPress theme is important and would be paramount whenever we would need to make WordPress themes. 
It is worth noting that Freedom is however granted to the implementation of a theme to edit the files here if they have any content although, I highly doubt there
would be anytime soon. Leave the contents of the style.css file as is â€” you can add more styling information to build the relevant themes but you are not allowed to
remove any content from it.

In the near future, documentation on the file structure might be added. Until that happens, please continue to refer to the WordPress documentation on how to make
themes and their expected directory structures and nuances.
